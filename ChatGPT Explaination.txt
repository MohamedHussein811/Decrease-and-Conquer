Certainly! Decrease and Conquer is a problem-solving technique in computer science 
where a problem is solved by dividing it into subproblems, solving one part of the problem, and then recursively applying the same approach to the remaining subproblems. 
The key idea is to reduce the problem size in a controlled manner until a base case is reached, which can be solved directly.

Lomuto Partition is a common algorithm used in quicksort for partitioning an array. Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that follows the Divide and Conquer paradigm.

Let's break down the Lomuto Partition algorithm:

Lomuto Partition Algorithm:

Choose a pivot element from the array. The pivot is used to divide the array into two partitions. 

Initialize two pointers, i and j, where i points to the first element of the array, and j iterates through the array from the second element. 

Iterate through the array using j. If the element at index j is less than or equal to the pivot, swap the element at index j with the element at index i, and increment i. 

Continue this process until j reaches the end of the array. 

Swap the pivot element with the element at index i (the position where the pivot belongs).

The array is now partitioned into two halves: elements less than or equal to the pivot on the left and elements greater than the pivot on the right. 

Recursively apply the same partitioning process to the left and right subarrays.
